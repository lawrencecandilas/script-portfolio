# script-portfolio

These are small scripts I've written that I've needed.

## Why?

I'm publishing them here to show off my script writing ability to others who may be interested.

## Random Details

- Most of these scripts will be `bash` scripts, intended to run under Debian Linux.

- I might include the occasional configuration file here, even though not a script per se.

- I have a home lab consisting of several devices with Linux installed, a PC acting as a router among those devices. You'll see more than a few scripts related to networking management.

- None of these will be examples of perfect programming or scripting practices, but if I've pushed something here, it got the job done

## AI

I didn't use any AI tools to write any of these, unless specifically indicated.
